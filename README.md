# React Template

###### Author: Matt Czencz

### Summary
This is a library / template I am working on to make a projects more consistent and faster. This is meant to work a lot like other libraries, such as Bootstrap and Bulma, but with my own premade styling and some bells and whistles I can customize. Below you will find a list of components, their properties  and value pairs to get the styling you desire.
